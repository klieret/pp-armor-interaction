This is a small calculator for calculating damage in a
[pen & paper RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game).
It is also a small experiment to try out [brython](https://brython.info/), that
is python for client-side web programming.

## How to run it

This will be deployed to github pages soon, but until then clone the repository
and start a small HTTP server

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

and open the link that is displayed.
